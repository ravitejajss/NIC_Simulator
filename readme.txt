Following are the instructions to Compile and run:

1/ To compile run:
	cd Lab2
    javac *.java

2/ To run the Simulator with default options just run:
	java NICSimulator

3/ If you want to change some parameters change them in NICSimulator.java and re-compile the code and run.

Please note for creation of Possion random variables I have used the code from princeton, as that is not a part of the assignment and I did not want to write it.
